<h1>Boil The Frog</h1>
<p>Boil The Frog is a website that will seamlessly create a playlist that transitions you from one artist to another regardless of genre. I think this is pretty amusing considering that you can put some wild genre
  changes in it and still it will create a playlist that transition.</p>

<h1>Radioooo</h1>
<p>Radiooo is a website that allows you to listen to the radio at any point in the world at any time going back to 1900.</p>
<p>This is amusing becuase I cannot believe the type of music that people of certain time periods and eras were listening to </p>

<h1>Pointer Painter</h1>
<p>Pointer Painter is a website that finds where your pointer is located on the screen and generates a picture with somebody pointing at your on-screen pointer. This is a really amusing website as there are some ridiculous
pictures that end up generating from it. I highly reccomend visiting this website if you want to laugh and burn a couple minutes from your day</p>
