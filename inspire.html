<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>Heroes are somebody who we can aspire to be and to model ourselves after. Somebody we take morale and ethical reflections from.</p>
<p>My personal hero is Phil Esposito who overcame a lot of adversity and somebody I could look up to and aspire to be. I modeled my game after this player as I initially had a lot of the same qualities as him and would later find how best to be like him.</p>
